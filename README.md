# PINK PINTEREST 🎀
MY FORST GITHUB PROJECT XD
It isn't perfect perfect but shape imo...
okayyy sooooo unfortunately I can publish this as a whole google extension :(
Here's how theoritically it should work.... (⊙ _ ⊙ )

	Step 1: Download all the files (You don't really need the README)
	Step 2: Open a folder in your machine titled "pinkiepie" no special characters otherwise the manifest won't work properly
	Step 3: Put all the files into the "pinkiepie" folder
	Step 4: Open Google
	Step 5: Naigate to chrome://extensions/ 
	Step 6: Toggle dev mode
	Step 7: Select "Load unpacked"
	Step 8: Select the pinkiepie folder
	Step 9: Enjoy the pink pinterest 

P.S if any other devs see this... PLEASE LET ME KNOW A BETTER WAY FOR MY CONSUMERS TO USE THIS PRODUCT ૮(˶╥︿╥)ა
I really really wanna share this with everyone cuz it's super cute and I want all my girlies to be able to have the most pinkiest and Croquettest pinterest evaaaaaa ₍₍⚞(˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)⚟⁾⁾

Thank you to everyone who decided to use this. It's honestly the best support anyone could give to help me in my dev journey 😌✨
